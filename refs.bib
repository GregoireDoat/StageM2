This so-called geometric phase may appear when the signal normalized second order instantaneous moment follows a smooth curve in the curved projective space. The resulting geometric phase is independent of the signal frequency and magnitude. Well known in quantum mechanics, optics or non-holonomic dynamical systems, the geometric phase can be computed using the concept of Bargmann invariant. It is associated to the time evolution of polarization parameters for bivariate signals. Numerical simulations on signal processing examples illustrate the pecular phenomenon of geometric phase.},

A nonstationary but oscillatory bivariate signal has a natural representation as an ellipse whose properties evolve in time, and this representation provides a simple geometric interpretation for the bivariate instantaneous moments. The bivariate bandwidth is shown to consist of three terms measuring the degree of instability of the time-varying ellipse: amplitude modulation with ﬁxed eccentricity, eccentricity modulation, and orientation modulation or precession. An application to the analysis of data from a free-drifting oceanographic ﬂoat is presented and discussed.},

The method, an extension of wavelet ridge analysis to the multivariate case, identiﬁes the common oscillation by seeking, at each point in time, a frequency for which a bandpassed version of the signal obtains a local maximum in power. The lowest-order bias is shown to involve a quantity, termed the instantaneous curvature, which measures the strength of local quadratic modulation of the signal after demodulation by the common oscillation frequency. The bias can be made to be small if the analysis ﬁlter, or wavelet, can be chosen such that the signal’s instantaneous curvature changes little over the ﬁlter time scale. An application is presented to the detection of vortex motions in a set of freely drifting oceanographic instruments tracking the ocean currents.},

We show the relevance of the quaternionic formulation of the solution, due to its ability to account for the evolution of its polarisation state over time. The existence of a periodic oscillation frequency between two polarisation states is demonstrated for the bivariate signal considered, which is known in physics as the Rabi frequency. A geometric Berry-Pancharatnam phase is also predicted for this bivariate signal model. The richness of this signal model is demonstrated on numerical simulations and the potential use of the geometric phase for the detection of gravitational wave precession is presented on realistic simulations.},

The time-frequency analysis of bivariate signals is usually carried out by analyzing two separate quantities, e.g. rotary components. We show that an adequate quaternion Fourier transform permits to build relevant time-frequency representations of bivariate signals that naturally identify geometrical or polarization properties. First, the quaternion embedding of bivariate signals is introduced, similar to the usual analytic signal of real signals. Then two fundamental theorems ensure that a quaternion short term Fourier transform and a quaternion continuous wavelet transform are well deﬁned and obey desirable properties such as conservation laws and reconstruction formulas. The resulting spectrograms and scalograms provide meaningful representations of both the time-frequency and geometrical/polarization content of the signal. Moreover the numerical implementation remains simply based on the use of FFT. A toolbox is available for reproducibility. Synthetic and real-world examples illustrate the relevance and eﬃciency of the proposed approach.},

This is especially the case in communication systems with amplitude or frequency modulation. These concepts are often introduced empirically. However, it is well known that the correct approach for this purpose is to use the concept of analytic signal. Starting from this point, we show some examples of contradictions appearing when using other deﬁnitions of instantaneous amplitude or frequency that are commonly admitted. This introduces the problem of characterizing pure amplitudemodulated or pure phase-modulated signals. It is especially shown that whereas amplitude modulated signals can be characterized by spectral considerations, this is no longer the case for phasemodulated signals. Furthermore, signals with constant amplitude have very speciﬁc properties, which are analyzed in detail. Some consequences and extensions to random signals are ﬁnally discussed.},

New complications, and possibilities, arise from the fact that there are several meaningful forms in which a time-varying ellipse may be represented. A perturbation analysis valid for the near-circular case clariﬁes these issues. Diagnosis of the ellipse properties may then be performed using wavelet ridge analysis, and slowly-varying changes in the ellipse structure may be decoupled from the fast orbital motion through the use of elliptic integrals, without the need for additional explicit ﬁltering.
