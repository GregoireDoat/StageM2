	abstract = {Many phenomena are described by bivariate signals or bidimensional vectors in applications ranging from radar to EEG, optics and oceanography. The time-frequency analysis of bivariate signals is usually carried out by analyzing two separate quantities, e.g. rotary components. We show that an adequate quaternion Fourier transform permits to build relevant time-frequency representations of bivariate signals that naturally identify geometrical or polarization properties. First, the quaternion embedding of bivariate signals is introduced, similar to the usual analytic signal of real signals. Then two fundamental theorems ensure that a quaternion short term Fourier transform and a quaternion continuous wavelet transform are well deﬁned and obey desirable properties such as conservation laws and reconstruction formulas. The resulting spectrograms and scalograms provide meaningful representations of both the time-frequency and geometrical/polarization content of the signal. Moreover the numerical implementation remains simply based on the use of FFT. A toolbox is available for reproducibility. Synthetic and real-world examples illustrate the relevance and eﬃciency of the proposed approach.},

The method, an extension of wavelet ridge analysis to the multivariate case, identiﬁes the common oscillation by seeking, at each point in time, a frequency for which a bandpassed version of the signal obtains a local maximum in power. The lowest-order bias is shown to involve a quantity, termed the instantaneous curvature, which measures the strength of local quadratic modulation of the signal after demodulation by the common oscillation frequency. The bias can be made to be small if the analysis ﬁlter, or wavelet, can be chosen such that the signal’s instantaneous curvature changes little over the ﬁlter time scale. An application is presented to the detection of vortex motions in a set of freely drifting oceanographic instruments tracking the ocean currents.},

This so-called geometric phase may appear when the signal normalized second order instantaneous moment follows a smooth curve in the curved projective space.

Well known in quantum mechanics, optics or non-holonomic dynamical systems, the geometric phase can be computed using the concept of Bargmann invariant.

This is especially the case in communication systems with amplitude or frequency modulation. These concepts are often introduced empirically. However, it is well known that the correct approach for this purpose is to use the concept of analytic signal. Starting from this point, we show some examples of contradictions appearing when using other deﬁnitions of instantaneous amplitude or frequency that are commonly admitted. This introduces the problem of characterizing pure amplitudemodulated or pure phase-modulated signals. It is especially shown that whereas amplitude modulated signals can be characterized by spectral considerations, this is no longer the case for phasemodulated signals. Furthermore, signals with constant amplitude have very speciﬁc properties, which are analyzed in detail. Some consequences and extensions to random signals are ﬁnally discussed.},

A perturbation analysis valid for the near-circular case clariﬁes these issues. Diagnosis of the ellipse properties may then be performed using wavelet ridge analysis, and slowly-varying changes in the ellipse structure may be decoupled from the fast orbital motion through the use of elliptic integrals, without the need for additional explicit ﬁltering.

The use of the analytic operator enables the instantaneous three-dimensional polarization state of any square-integrable trivariate signal to be uniquely deﬁned. Straightforward expressions are given which permit the ellipse parameters to be recovered from data. The notions of instantaneous frequency and instantaneous bandwidth, generalized to the trivariate case, are related to variations in the ellipse properties. Rates of change of the ellipse parameters are found to be intimately linked to the ﬁrst few moments of the signal’s spectrum, averaged over the three signal components. In particular, the trivariate instantaneous bandwidth—a measure of the instantaneous departure of the signal from a single pure sinusoidal oscillation—is found to contain ﬁve contributions: three essentially two-dimensional effects due to the motion of the ellipse within a ﬁxed plane, and two effects due to the motion of the plane containing the ellipse. The resulting analysis method is an informative means of describing nonstationary trivariate signals, as is illustrated with an application to a seismic record.},

	title = {Polarization analysis and optimization geometry},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-03604462},
	abstract = {In the first part of this thesis, we introduce the concept of polarization of bivariate signals by comparing several approaches present in the literature. In particular, a complex representation and a vector representation are identified. We compare these representations and highlight the fact that they induce differences in treatment. We devote a section to the definition of the instantaneous polarization, in a similar spirit to that of the definition of the instantaneous frequency. We then argue that signal representation plays a strong role in the identification of certain instantaneous parameters. As an example, we explore in more detail a representation of polarization via an embedding of complex signals in the quaternion algebra. This work is the result of a thesis which precedes us by a short time. After noting the ease of writing allowed by the quaternionic embedding, we give theoretical explanations for the success of such an enterprise. To this end, an algebraic approach to the Fourier transform is proposed, then the link between quaternion algebra and geometric algebras is established. The geometric algebras provide a new type of object: the spinors whose interest in the representation of polarization is highlighted. In the last chapter of this part, we explore through trivariate signals the extension of polarization analysis to n-variate signals and formulate an analysis based on the study of invariants. We understand polarization transformations as the action of the group U(n) on the space of possible covariance matrices for a trivariate signal. In the second part, we propose a method for solving particular optimization problems of the density estimation type. The form of the problem is known in advance but the particular problem depends on an observation vector that changes at each acquisition. Our functions are defined on differentiable manifolds, and under certain conditions on the form of the optimization problem, we show that pre-computed solutions can be used as a basis to estimate a solution in a predictable time. This part calls for knowledge in differential geometry, the gist of which is given in the first chapter. We also recall some results on the convergence of Newton's methods and give a brief overview of homotopic methods.

	title = {Mathematical tools and signal processing algorithms for the study of gravitational waves polarization},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-04220715},
	abstract = {This thesis is an interdisciplinary project aiming at proposing new methodologies and algorithms to characterize the polarization of non-stationary polarized signals and to apply these new tools to the context of gravitational wave astronomy. The direct observation of gravitational waves made possible by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors constitutes a paradigm shift for the study of compact astrophysical objects such as black holes and neutron stars. Analysis of the large volume of data from these detectors has so far focused on the morphology of the recorded waveform, from which information about the nature of the source can be extracted. The polarization of the waves has received less attention because the number of detectors was insufficient to draw accurate conclusions. However, polarization information is of interest for some astrophysical sources. For example, for mergers of compact binary star systems, the precession of the orbital plane results in a specific evolution of the polarization pattern. This thesis starts from the fundamental theoretical aspects of the representation and characterization of polarized signals to develop analysis and synthesis tools adapted to the context of the considered application. The results presented are of three kinds. First, the different representations of amplitude, frequency and polarization modulated signals are reviewed, evaluating their usefulness for the analysis and synthesis of these signals. This review highlights the problems caused by the degeneracy of certain representations, specifies the conditions of its occurrence and proposes ways to remedy it. On the basis of this study, generative machine learning models are built, and applied to the fast computation of gravitational waveforms, thus allowing the acceleration of the inference of the source parameters. This generative model is proposed both for binary black hole sources without precession and with precession, and its accuracy is evaluated in each case. Finally, new regularization principles based on polarization a priori are introduced to improve the reconstruction of the two signal components from observational data. The method is evaluated on realistic synthetic data. It allows to target the analysis on certain source categories associated with a particular polarization.},

	abstract = {A vector-valued signal in N dimensions is a signal whose value at any time instant is an N dimensional vector, that is, an element of RN . The sum of an arbitrary number of such signals of the same frequency is shown to trace an ellipse in N -dimensional space, that is, to be conﬁned to a plane. The parameters of the ellipse (major and minor axes, represented by N -dimensional vectors; and phase) are obtained algebraically in terms of the directions of oscillation of the constituent signals, and their phases. It is shown that the major axis of the ellipse can always be determined algebraically. That is, a vector, whose value can be computed algebraically (without decisions or comparisons of magnitude) from parameters of the constituent signals, always represents the major axis of the ellipse. The ramiﬁcations of this result for the processing and Fourier analysis of signals with vector values or samples are discussed, with reference to the deﬁnition of Fourier transforms, particularly discrete Fourier transforms, such as have been deﬁned in several hypercomplex algebras, including Cliﬀord algebras. The treatment in the paper, however, is entirely based on signals with values in RN . Although the paper is written in terms of vector signals (which are taken to include images and volumetric images), the analysis clearly also applies to a superposition of simple harmonic motions in N dimensions.},

Moreover, we show how these important submanifolds are related to other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.

Its most common formulations are known as the Aharonov–Bohm phase and the Pancharatnam and Berry phase, but both earlier and later manifestations exist. Although traditionally attributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized and become increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics and optics to high-energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review, we first introduce the Aharonov–Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric phase. Then, we discuss in detail the broader meaning, consequences and realizations of the geometric phase, emphasizing the most important mathematical methods and experimental techniques used in the study of the geometric phase, in particular those related to recent works in optics and condensed-matter physics.},

The existence of a periodic oscillation frequency between two polarisation states is demonstrated for the bivariate signal considered, which is known in physics as the Rabi frequency. A geometric Berry-Pancharatnam phase is also predicted for this bivariate signal model. The richness of this signal model is demonstrated on numerical simulations and the potential use of the geometric phase for the detection of gravitational wave precession is presented on realistic simulations.},

	title = {Une approche générique pour l'analyse et le filtrage des signaux bivariés},
	copyright = {Licence Etalab},
	url = {https://theses.fr/2018ECLI0008},
	abstract = {Les signaux bivariés apparaissent dans de nombreuses applications (optique, sismologie, océanographie, EEG, etc.) dès lors que l'analyse jointe de deux signaux réels est nécessaire. Les signaux bivariés simples ont une interprétation naturelle sous la forme d'une ellipse dont les propriétés (taille, forme, orientation) peuvent évoluer dans le temps. Cette propriété géométrique correspondant à la notion de polarisation en physique est fondamentale pour la compréhension et l'analyse des signaux bivariés. Les approches existantes n'apportent cependant pas de description directe des signaux bivariés ou des opérations de filtrage en termes de polarisation. Cette thèse répond à cette limitation par l'introduction d'une nouvelle approche générique pour l'analyse et le filtrage des signaux bivariés. Celle-ci repose sur deux ingrédients essentiels : (i) le plongement naturel des signaux bivariés -- vus comme signaux à valeurs complexes -- dans le corps des quaternions H et (ii) la définition d'une transformée de Fourier quaternionique associée pour une représentation spectrale interprétable de ces signaux. L'approche proposée permet de définir les outils de traitement de signal usuels tels que la notion de densité spectrale, de filtrage linéaire ou encore de spectrogramme ayant une interprétation directe en termes d'attributs de polarisation. Nous montrons la validité de l'approche grâce à des garanties mathématiques et une implémentation numériquement efficace des outils proposés. Diverses expériences numériques illustrent l'approche. En particulier, nous démontrons son potentiel pour la caractérisation de la polarisation des ondes gravitationnelles.},

	abstract = {We discuss the Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci equations for a Riemannian immersion. The O’Neill tensors for a Riemannian submersion are introduced and applied to the FubiniStudy metric on CPn. Moreover, we discuss the case of a vector bundle equipped with a connection and ﬁbre metric over a Riemannian manifold and show how to equip the vector bundle with an induced Riemannian metric. This construction is analyzed as a Riemannian immersion and a Riemannian submersion, and the precise conditions under which the O’Neill tensors vanish is determined.},
